# 2. Introduction

## 2.1. Overview

The purpose of the **International Safety Management** (ISM) Code is to provide an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention.

The Code establishes safety-management objectives and requires a safety management system (SMS) to be established by "the Company", which is defined as the owner or any other organisation or person, such as the manager, who has assumed responsibility for operating the ship and who, on assuming such responsibility, has agreed to take over all duties and responsibility imposed by the Code.

The Company is then required to establish and implement a policy for achieving these objectives. This includes providing the necessary resources and shore-based support.

Every company is expected ***to designate a person or persons ashore having direct access to the highest level of management*** in order to provide a link between the company and those on board.

The procedures required by the Code should be documented and compiled in a Safety Management Manual, a copy of which should be kept on board.

The SMS ensures compliance with all applicable international rules & regulations for safe management of ships and pollution prevention, including the International Safety Management (ISM) Code. Additionally, Codes of Practice, guidelines and standards recommended by Classification Societies and maritime organisations are also considered.

## 2.2. General

**Objectives**

The objectives of the **Yachting Concept Monaco** have been established to ensure safety at sea, prevention of human injury or loss of life and to avoid damage to the environment: To this end we endeavour to;

- Provide a safe, efficient, effective and professional yacht management service through the implementation of an appropriately controlled Safety Management System;
- Assess and mitigate all risks to yachts, personnel and the environment;
- Provide for safe practices in yacht operation and a safe working environment;
- Continuously improve the safety management skills of personnel ashore and on board.

**Scope:** The scope of this SMM applies to all personnel involved in any activity that concerns the safe operation of the yacht and pollution prevention. This includes all on-board activities and departments of Operations, including Technical, Financial and Administration ashore.

## 2.3. Working language

The working language is **English**. The office team, as well as on-board personnel, must have an adequate command of the English language to enable communication on yacht-related technical, operational and safety matters.

The Safety Management System and the Safety Management Manual is developed in English only and should fully understood by the company personnel and ship crew members.
